## The Occident Club
The Meridian Occident Club was founded on June 19, 1924 as a women's organization dtermined to work toward the betterment of Meridian, Idaho in any civic or social capacity. Examples of the club's community work include providing flour and clothing donations to the Red Cross during the Great Depression, the purchasing of war bonds and the filling of army kits to support the military during World War II, and the organization of an "Emrgency Loan Chest" in which those in the community without the means to purchase needed medical equipment could take out their needed items on loan. The most significant impact of the Occident Club, however, was the library. As the age of the club's membership increased, and new members decreased, the club eventually held its last meeting in January 1996 and finalized the donation of its remianing funds into community needs.  
## The Occident Club & The Library
The longest lasting legacy of the Meridian Occident Club is their creation of a Meridian public library. Having started the first community traveling library at Songer Pharmacy in September 1924 (with only six books), the library continued to grow under the club's direction for fifty years. In 1930, during the Great Depression, the club purchased its first clubhouse building, which was also to house the library. The club organized fundraisers to keep the library functional, and even paid off their bulding loan debt by 1939. In subsequent decades, continued club fundraisers, such as pancake breakfasts, allowed for Meridian residents to maintain access to both books and other library services. Unfortunately, as the surrounding community continued to grow in population, the library became too difficult for the women of the Occident Club to maintain its functionality. In May 1974, just before the opening of the newly remodeled library containing 13,000 books, the club initiated legal steps to turn over control of the library to the city in order to form a library district. The Meridian Library District continues to this day. Any individual that has ever checked out a book or recieved any other service or benefit from the Meridian Library District owes their access to these resources to the early efforts of the women of the Occident Club.
